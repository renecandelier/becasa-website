Joanie says, \"The ocean has always been my temple, and it has become more so as I get older.\" Joanie explains, \"My most vital dream came about when I was 11 - when the movie Endless Summer was out. I went to see it every day at the theater for a week. Then, from that, I wanted to go to every beautiful surf spot in the world. And I wanted to see Oahu and the pipeline. <\/p><p><strong>\"My grandfather always told me that if you feel you have a problem, take a walk on the beach,\" I've taken that to heart in my life,\" says Joanie. <\/strong><\/p><p>As a senior in high school, Joanie went to Rincon, Puerto Rico, to visit friends at a surf camp (spring break, perhaps). \"I got off the public bus at midnight. Pitch black. I can't put it into words – but I knew in my heart that I was supposed to be there,\" Joanie says. After staying there for the week she had planned, Joanie walked into town to the pay phone daily, attempting to phone her mom. \"I was trying to tell her that I wasn't coming home, and when she finally answered, she said … we'll then I'm coming to Puerto Rico.\" Her mom came and stayed at the Villa Cofresi Hotel. After three days, she told Joanie that she got it – she understood why she was there. \"I stayed for two years. I slept in a surfboard box under a mosquito net, and we all lived simply.\"<\/p><p>Later, Joanie moved to Hawaii and lived at the Banzai Pipeline. She did what she wanted to do. When asked, \"Do you believe in manifestation?\" Joanie chuckles, \"Sure, I believe in that - but I don't know that it always comes true. But I believe the universe is endless and can give you anything.\" <\/p><p>After living in Hawaii for years, Joanie returned to New York to visit. \"I was offered a job in the city and stayed.\" Joanie began working with her stepfather in his button business, Bobbi Trim Ltd. \"At the time, 90% of clothing was made in the USA, and all was done with one of the button styles we produced. So, yes, we were busy.\" <\/p><p>So Joanie was invited to visit factories in Italy - she arrived at 7AM in her \"uniform\" – jeans, cowboy boots, a white t-shirt, Ray Ban sunglasses, and a v-neck cashmere sweater.\" Immediately, Mauro said, \"Oh, Joanie, you're so American. We need to get you some new sunglasses immediately.\" Mauro and his wife, Ester, took Joanie under their wing, and they've all become best friends for over 37 years. Joanie began to grasp what could be birthed with the resources at hand and with her keen eye for design and fashion. <\/p><p>Bobbi Trim became one of the most fashion-forward button manufacturers in New York City. <\/p><p>Their business grew into various Italian-made buttons for high-end designers, including Perry Ellis, Donna Karan, Anne Klein, Calvin Klein, Proenza Schuler, Nicole Miller, Anna Sui, and Marc Jacobs. <\/p><p>After many years, the button business began to move to China – and the venture capitalists were buying up all the fashion houses. \"It was sad. Everything changed in American fashion. I didn't know what I wanted to do – it was a shift, and everyone was stuck. I remember when some of the huge accounts spending 1 million a year with us on buttons dwindled to nothing. I just cried out in those moments, <strong>\"Please tell me what to do – and the universe responded to me.\"<\/strong><\/p>","text_font_class":"fs-body-100"}}},"block_order":["template--15838849040437__253c6cc3-8a54-4d0f-badb-d543f61d86f7-heading-1","template--15838849040437__253c6cc3-8a54-4d0f-badb-d543f61d86f7-text-1"],"settings":{"alignment":"left_left","enable_animation":true,"divider_style":"none","section_padding":"section--vertical-padding-top-bottom","content_width":"custom","custom_content_width":700}},"259f0a58-9dee-45f7-95f3-180cb862d5dd":{"type":"image-hero-split","blocks":{"template--15376799727669__259f0a58-9dee-45f7-95f3-180cb862d5dd-1668222967ce8aad84-0":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Screen_Shot_2023-12-10_at_2.49.53_PM.png","image_mobile":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Screen_Shot_2023-12-10_at_2.49.53_PM.png","focal_point":"top","mobile_focal_point":"center","title":"","text":"","link":"","link_text":"","button_style":"btn--primary"}},"template--15376799727669__259f0a58-9dee-45f7-95f3-180cb862d5dd-1668222967ce8aad84-1":{"type":"image","settings":{"image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Screen_Shot_2023-12-10_at_2.48.10_PM.png","image_mobile":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Screen_Shot_2023-12-10_at_2.48.10_PM.png","focal_point":"bottom","mobile_focal_point":"center","title":"","text":"","link":"","link_text":"","button_style":"btn--primary"}}},"block_order":["template--15376799727669__259f0a58-9dee-45f7-95f3-180cb862d5dd-1668222967ce8aad84-0","template--15376799727669__259f0a58-9dee-45f7-95f3-180cb862d5dd-1668222967ce8aad84-1"],"settings":{"image_aspect":"custom","desktop_height":100,"mobile_height":100,"text_position":"center","text_color":"#ffffff","button_background_color":"#ffffff","button_text_color":"#000000","color_overlay":"#000000","color_overlay_gradient":"","overlay_opacity":0,"enable_animation":true,"section_padding":"section--vertical-padding-none"}},"f1e66d79-ae53-4640-96c2-617b384f53d7":{"type":"featured-collection-grid","blocks":{"48bc4e1a-e2bf-44c6-8bc8-f7ac5a14c427":{"type":"collection","settings":{"collection":"pono-mini-feature"}}},"block_order":["48bc4e1a-e2bf-44c6-8bc8-f7ac5a14c427"],"settings":{"heading":"","subheading":"","link":"","link_text":"","maximum_collections":4,"columns":"4","mobile_columns":"2","enable_animation":true,"divider_style":"none","section_padding":"section--vertical-padding-top-bottom"}},"93cb48a3-4581-4263-8cd7-97f6b6895164":{"type":"rich-text","blocks":{"template--15838849040437__93cb48a3-4581-4263-8cd7-97f6b6895164-text-1":{"type":"text","settings":{"text":"<p>\"I knew the beautiful materials we used to make the buttons would not die – it could be something else.\" Joanie laughed, <strong>\"My grandmother vacuumed in her Pucci dress; my whole family was into fashion; it was all somewhat genetic for me.\"<\/strong><\/p><p>Joanie spoke with one of her good friends in the industry – Mauro, a great designer who worked heavily with Italian resin about creating something else with the materials she'd work with in button-making, and he said, \"Come to Italy, come see what we're producing and get inspired by what could be.\" Joanie said, \"I'll never forget it – Mauro said, <strong>\"If that is what you want to do, then you must do it, and you must do it immediately.\" <\/strong><\/p><p>As Joanie explains, \"PONO was born out of a practicality at first - it was intellectual for me, and through the years, I've been able to grow it into a passion, an emotional connection, and have a real appreciation for the work,' says Joanie.<\/p><p>\"The first product I designed in Italy that week was our horn bangle.
